This is a new interactive course from Google about how to do image classification.  
Machine Learning Crash Course was openly launched sometime back which is really good.  
I'm still going through this interactive walk through and this too is really good.  
Specially the part in the exercise in which there was a visualiation of how different features are extracted using filters in different layers.  
I haven't gone into the details of the code yet from Exercise 1. I just ran it through to see what all it does.
